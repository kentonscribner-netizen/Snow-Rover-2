## 11/5/2025 - completed the upper artifact transfer system in CAD!  

Since this is my first journal, and I have already started this project I will explain what is happening now and what I need to get done in the future!

As of today, I am about eighty percent complete with the CAD and ninety percent done with the drivetrain and chassis of the robot! So far, the robot contains 6 different stages of transfer for the artifacts of which 5 are designed and 1 is already partially built. First, we have the Initial intake, then the Upper transfer system, Uptake injector system, Uptake transfer system, Shooter and Turret! So, what's next? Well, I have to design the Hood, mounting brackets for battery and hubs, side panels for aesthetics and robot signs. Since our team will be ordering the remaining parts tomorrow the rest of the CAD should be done by the time the parts get here and then we can start assembling, printing, coding and wiring. (The fun part!)
              

The fun stuff! \/

This is a screenshot of the entire transfer system designed so far and the path the [artifact](https://andymark.com/products/ftc-25-26-am-3376a) takes before it gets shot out.

This is a screenshot of just the Initial Intake (Left) the upper transfer system (Middle) and the Uptake injector system (Upper Left) and the path that the artifact takes as well as direction of rotation of the [boot wheels](https://www.gobilda.com/3615-series-boot-wheel-8mm-rex-bore-48mm-diameter-30a-durometer/).
